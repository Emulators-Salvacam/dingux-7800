LOADING ROM FILES (A78)
------------

If you want to load rom images in the virtual drive of
your emulator, you have to put your rom file (with
.zip or .a78 file extension) on your WIZ SD memory
in the 'roms' directory. 

Then, while inside Atari 7800 emulator, just press
Menu to enter in the emulator main menu, choose
"Load ROM" and then using the file selector choose one
game file to load in your emulator. Back to the
emulator window, your game should run automatically.

You can now use the Keyboard menu and edit, load and
save your keyboard mapping files inside the emulator.
The Save option save the .kbd file in the kbd
directory using the "Game Name" as filename. The game
name is displayed on the right corner in the emulator
menu.

CHEAT CODE (.CHT)
----------

  You can use cheat codes with this emulator.  You
can add your own cheat codes in the cheat.txt file
and then import them in the cheat menu.  

  All cheat codes you have specified for a game can
be save in a CHT file in 'cht' folder.  Those cheat
codes would then be automatically loaded when you
start the game.

The CHT file format is the following :
#
# Enable, Address, Value, Comment
#
1,36f,3,Cheat comment

  Using the Cheat menu you can search for modified
bytes in RAM between current time and the last time
you saved the RAM. It might be very usefull to find
"poke" address by yourself, monitoring for example
life numbers.

To find a new "poke address" you can proceed as
follow :

Let's say you're playing Xevious and you want to
find the memory address where "number lives" is
stored.

. Start a new game in Xevious
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Choose Save Ram to save initial state of the memory. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan Old Value" field.
  (for Xevious the initial lives number is 4)
. Go back to the game and loose a life.
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan New Value" field.
  (for Xevious the lives number is now 3)
. In Add Cheat you have now one matching Address
  (for Xevious it's 1A6E)
. Specify the Poke value you want (for example 4) 
  and add a new cheat with this address / value.

The cheat is now activated in the cheat list and you
can save it using the "Save cheat" menu.

Let's enjoy Xevious with infinite life !!
